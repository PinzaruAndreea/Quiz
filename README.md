# Quiz
  This was my first JavaScript project. Of course, I added some features, did all the CSS code (since the udemy JS course used bootstrap instead) and, hopefully, made it responsive for most devices. I created a few "const" and one "let". The first constant "correctAnswers" is an array that will be later used in a forEach() method to check that the value the user inputs matches that array. Overall, I created a click event, which prompts a div to pop up with the score (let) of the user. As an extra, I added the refresh button for the form next to the submit button, so that the user can refresh the page and start all over again with the quiz.
